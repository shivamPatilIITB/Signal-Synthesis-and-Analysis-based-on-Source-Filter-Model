**Resume points:**

Signal Synthesis and Analysis based on Source Filter Model | Speech Processing

Instructor: Prof. Preeti Rao, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Aug’22 - Sep’22)

(a) Designed a three formant resonator and implemented linear constant coefficient difference equation to
model an LTI system which is further used to synthesize vowel sounds

(b) Performed signal analysis using DFT on synthesized vowels with different window lengths to obtain formant
frequencies and fundamental frequency

**Explanations for each point:**

(a) Please refer the points highlighted in "comp-assn1A-2022.pdf" for questions and "213070003_A01.ipynb" for these points. Question 4 (a), (b) and (c) in the ipynb file contains the implementation for synthesis of vowel sounds using three formant resonator and implemented linear constant coefficient difference equation.
In order to listen to the synthesized vowel sounds, open the links available on top of this page in Google colab.

(b) Please refer the points highlighted in "comp-assn1B-2022.pdf" for questions and "213070003_A01_B.ipynb" for implementation. In order to listen to the synthesized vowel sounds, open the links available on top of this page on your colab notebook.

-- DFT is computed using different window lengths and Formant frequencies (F1, F2 and F3) and fundamental frequency (F0) are computed. Observations are provided 
below each section.
